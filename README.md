Calculate the Fade percentage value of a CS:GO skin based on a given seed value. Supporting all
[Fade skins](https://csgoskins.gg/families/fade) except for gloves. Easily convert every paint seed
(also called pattern index) into a fade percentage value, or get a full list of all paint seeds and
the corresponding fade percentages.

## üöÄ Installation

In order to install the latest package version from
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csgo-fade-percentage-calculator), simply run:

```bash
npm install csgo-fade-percentage-calculator
```

## üõ† Usage

```js
const { FadeCalculator } = require('csgo-fade-percentage-calculator');

// Get a list of all fade percentages for all available weapons.
const allFadePercentages = FadeCalculator.getAllFadePercentages();

// Get a list of fade percentages for the Karambit.
const karambitFadePercentages = FadeCalculator.getFadePercentages('Karambit');

// Get the fade percentage for the AWP and the seed 123.
const awpFadePercentage = FadeCalculator.getFadePercentage('AWP', 123);

// Get all supported weapons.
const supportedWeapons = FadeCalculator.getSupportedWeapons();
```

## üìú How It Works

Each CS:GO weapon skin has a random paint seed value between 0 and 999. This paint seed value, sometimes also
called pattern index, determines the positioning of the pattern on the gun. Specifically, the paint seed determines
the X offset, Y offset, and rotation value for the pattern position. Those three values can be calculated using
an algorithm which has been open-sourced by Valve.

Luckily, all Fade skins have the same X and Y offsets, and only the rotation value changes with each paint seed.
This package simply converts paint seeds to rotation values, and then assigns each rotation value a fade percentage
between 80 and 100, where the lowest rotation value is a 100% Fade, and the highest rotation value is an 80% Fade.

The whole process just involves simple math, and it is superior to alternative methods such as image pixel color
analysis for various reasons:

- The resulting Fade percentage values are 100% accurate
- The methodology can be easily verified and reproduced
- The algorithm is simple and fast

## üåé Platform Support

There are already a few platforms that use the open-source algorithm implemented by this package to generate
fade percentage values. The sites below all share the same fade percentage values, which can also be generated by
this package:

- [Skinport](https://skinport.com/)
- [CSGOSKINS.GG](https://csgoskins.gg/)

Other sites are currently known to use their own algorithms, probably based on image analysis. These sites come
to different conclusions which paint seed corresponds to which fade value, as pixel color analysis is not
very accurate to determine a fade value:

- [CS.MONEY](https://cs.money/)
- [BUFF163](https://buff.163.com/)
- [BroSkins](https://broskins.com/)

## ‚≠ê Credits

Thanks to [Step7750](https://github.com/Step7750), the work on this library was inspired by
[his research](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/b7g538/psa_how_paint_seed_actually_works_technical/)
about CS:GO paint seeds. He also implemented Valve's uniform random number generator
[in Go](https://github.com/Step7750/UniformRandom), which was ported to TypeScript for this project.
